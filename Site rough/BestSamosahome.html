  <p>Our Story...﻿Bea gonfa is a vendor at St. Catharines farmer’s market providing authentic healthy vegan & vegetarian samosas, soups, spreads and salads.﻿  Bea Gonfa got started making handmade Samosas to potlucks and churches since 2005.  One day, she was sitting with her friends hosting Samosas and tea, sharing her concerns what to do to help her daughter who has been a Niagara College graduate with no luck to secure a job to support herself and her child as a single parent. One of her friends suggested if she can sell these Samosas to the Farmers market.

Bea didn’t know if she could do it. With her friends help and support, she 1st established at Ridge way Farmers market, working out of a small kitchen hosting different events at Art Sanctuary and the Legion in Ridgeway introducing “Ethio Fusion” vegan/ vegetarian foods. She has been on a local news paper giving out samples of her Samosas with a choice of spicy and non spicy.  

Bea Gonfa is willing to continue her passion to cook and love of people to create a meaningful work not only for her daughter as well as others in the community who are willing to better themselves partnering with a nonprofit organization called INSOW (international Social Organization for Women).
